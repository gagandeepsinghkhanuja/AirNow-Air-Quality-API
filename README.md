# Florida AQI Monitoring and Visualization

## Overview

This project leverages the AirNow API to monitor air quality across all zip codes in Florida. Using Python for data automation and Streamlit for interactive data visualization, this tool provides real-time insights into key pollutants, including AQI (Air Quality Index), PM2.5, PM10, and O3.

The project is designed to:

	•	Retrieve current, forecast, and historical AQI data using the AirNow API.
	•	Visualize AQI data on an interactive map using Streamlit and Plotly.
	•	Help users monitor air quality across different regions in Florida and make informed decisions.
